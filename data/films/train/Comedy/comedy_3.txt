The working-class caddies, such as Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), try to earn a little money and the slightest crumb of respect from the wealthy patrons who golf there. Noonan tries desperately to ontain the Bushwood (college) scholarship, though his efforts to kiss up to the Judge Smails prove futile. After a series of misadventures, and a climactic final gold tournament, Czervik shows the Judge who's really the best golfer at Bushwood.
